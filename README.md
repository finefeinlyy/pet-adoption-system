# Pet Adoption System

This project is a web-based **Pet Adoption System** that allows users to register pets, manage adopters, and handle pet adoption operations. It serves as an enhanced version of a similar system I previously developed in **C#** during my university studies. This time, I aimed to transform it into a modern, responsive, and interactive web application using **React.js** and other modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - Framer Motion for animations
- **Backend (Simulated)**:
  - Data is managed with JavaScript objects for simplicity.
  - Mock services for registering pets and adopters, and handling adoption logic.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from a **C#** I developed during a university class, where I learned the basics of object-oriented programming. By converting it into a web application, I wanted to expand my skills in modern web development and create something more accessible and user-friendly.

## Future Plans for Enhancement

While the current implementation provides basic functionality, I plan to enhance the system further with the following features:

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Replace the current mock services with a real backend using **Node.js** or **Django**, and integrate a database like **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Add login and authentication features for admins and adopters.

3. **Advanced Search and Filters**:
   - Allow filtering pets by specific criteria, such as breed, gender, or age range.

4. **Pet Profiles**:
   - Include detailed profiles for each pet with a gallery, vaccination records, and more.

5. **Adoption History**:
   - Maintain records of adoption history for both pets and adopters.

6. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Add an admin panel to monitor and manage system data more efficiently.
